# Monte Carlo optimisation of H-atom positions

This library optimises the positions of H-atoms in a molecule, keeping the positions of the other atoms fixed. 

## Installation and Dependencies 
This is dependent on: 
- numpy (do I need to tell you how to download numpy?)
- ase (see [their documentation](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/install.html) for installation instructions)

## TODO
- Seems good for poor initial guesses, but not good for good initial guesses 
- Add final geometry opt on top
