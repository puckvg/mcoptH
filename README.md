# Monte Carlo optimisation of H-atom positions

This library optimises the positions of H-atoms in a molecule, keeping the positions of the other atoms fixed. 

## Installation and Dependencies 
This is dependent on: 
- numpy (do I need to tell you how to download numpy?)
- openbabel [download instructions](https://openbabel.org/docs/dev/Installation/install.html)

## TODO
Perturbations to the molecule are currently so bad that the optimiser never converges or gets better...
