# Monte Carlo optimisation of H-atom positions

This library optimises the positions of H-atoms in a molecule, keeping the positions of the other atoms fixed. 

## Installation and Dependencies 
This is dependent on: 
- openbabel [download instructions](https://openbabel.org/docs/dev/Installation/install.html)
- sphere_point_picking from generate_coordinates [here](https://github.com/puckvg/generate_coordinates)
- tools [here](https://github.com/puckvg/tools)

## TODO
Perturbations to the molecule are currently so bad that the optimiser never converges or gets better...
